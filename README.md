# Unity3D-augmented-reality-applications
This repository has details regarding augmented reality (AR) based applications developed using Unity3D and Vuforia SDK for smart learning.
In order to make learning effective, handheld marker-based AR technology is used for primary school students. Four applications based on students’ academic courses at the primary school level are developed for learning purposes of the English alphabet, decimal numbers, animals and birds, and an AR Globe for knowing about different countries around the world.
These applications are:
##1. Nursery Rhyme
